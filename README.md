# advent-of-code-2023
This repository contains my personal (and incomplete) solutions to Advent of Code 2023, covering Days 1 through 17. Each day's challenge has two parts:
```
Part 1 is implemented in a.py
Part 2 is implemented in b.py
```
Both parts read input from a shared file named **data.txt**. The data.txt files contain my personal puzzle inputs. If you want to try solving the problems yourself, I recommend using your own input, which you can get from [your Advent of Code account](https://adventofcode.com/2023).
